<h3>The Ultimate Weight Loss Calculator – How to work out your frame size!</h3>

Working out your frame size can be tricky and is often inaccurate – we are all different shapes and sizes, and the only way to know for sure is to get a full body scan! It’s also true that as you lose weight, your wrist circumference could change significantly, so this should be used as a rough indication only.

However, having a general idea of your frame size or build can be useful when using weight loss calculators, as you will be able to adjust the results.

<h4>Method 1</h4>

To get a rough idea of your body frame size, just circle the thinnest part of your wrist with your thumb and fingers. If your thumb and fingers don’t touch, you have a large frame. If they only just touch, you have an average frame. If they overlap, you have a small frame.

However, this isn’t a very accurate measure – you might just have longer or shorter than average fingers! A slightly more accurate impression can be gained from measuring your wrist circumference.

<h4>Method 2</h4>

Wrist circumference should be measured using a soft tape-measure. Measure at the wrist crease, the area between the bottom of your palm, and your wrist bone. Compare the measurement to the table below.

<h4>Women:</h4>

 
<h5>Height under 5’2″</h5>
Small frame = wrist size less than 5.5″<br>
Medium frame = wrist size 5.5″ to 5.75″<br>
Large frame = wrist size over 5.75″<br>

<h5>Height 5’2″ to 5′ 5″</h5>
Small frame = wrist size less than 6″<br>
Medium frame = wrist size 6″ to 6.25″<br>
Large frame = wrist size over 6.25″<br>

<h5>Height over 5′ 5″</h5>

Small frame = wrist size less than 6.25″<br>
Medium frame = wrist size 6.25″ to 6.5″<br>
Large frame = wrist size over 6.5″<br>

<h4>Men:</h4>
<h5>All Heights</h5>

Small frame = wrist size 5.5″ to 6.5″<br>
Medium frame = wrist size 6.5″ to 7.5″<br>
Large frame = wrist size over 7.5″<br>
